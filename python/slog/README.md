# SLog

SLog (Simple-Log) is a simplified logging system, piggybacking on python "logging" module.

> this is just to avoid code duplication in other projects, as I always my log to look and behave the same

to use in your projects, just use the default logging methods :
 - `logging.info`
 - `logging.warning`
 - `logging.error`
 - etc...
